        <h3>Commands</h3>
        <pre>
If you want to delete all your commit history but keep the code in its current state, 
it is very safe to do it as in the following:

1. Checkout/create orphan branch (this branch won't show in git branch command):
git checkout --orphan latest_branch

2. Add all the files to the newly created branch:
git add -A

3. Commit the changes:
git commit -am "commit message"

4. Delete main (default) branch (this step is permanent):
git branch -D main

5. Rename the current branch to main:
git branch -m main

6. Finally, all changes are completed on your local repository, and force update your remote repository:
git push -f origin main

PS: This will not keep your old commit history around. Now you should only see your new commit in the history of your git repository.
